\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes a new one-pass sketching algorithm for finding the Tucker Decomposition for large tensors in a streaming model. Theorem 3.1 presents an error bound for the tensor approximation which grows linearly with dimension $N$. In addition, our experiments and application experiments compare the error generated from our algorithm with that of the widely used Tucker Decomposition.
